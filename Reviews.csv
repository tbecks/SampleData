The entry to the hotel was very steep and narrow. Not a very welcoming experience.
Very disappointed in the temperature of the jacuzzi. It was cold
Unfortunately the A/C in our room was broken. The staff was very friendly and fixed it right away. 
Great views of the ocean. Literally steps from the beach. The large playground was great for the kids. 
The property could use some updates but super clean. The best location for value in my opinion.
Our room was on the ground floor - great view. The bike rentals are a great plus and would definitely come back for the breakfast!
